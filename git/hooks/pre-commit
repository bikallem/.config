## This simply searches the files that you are about to commit.
##

changed=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

if [[ -z "$changed" ]]
then
    exit 0
fi

echo $changed | xargs egrep '[><]{7}' -H -I --line-number

## If the egrep command has any hits - echo a warning and exit with non-zero status.
if [ $? == 0 ]
then
    echo "\n\nWARNING: You have merge markers in the above files, lines. Fix them before committing.\n\n"
    exit 1
fi

branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"

if [ "$branch" = "master" ]; then
  echo "You can't commit directly to master branch"
  exit 1
fi
